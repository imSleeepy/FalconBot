ARTICLE I. INTRODUCTION


        Dr. George Lucas Adamson, a Greek chemist from Athens, founded the Adamson School of Industrial Chemistry (ASIC) on June 20, 1932 to train young men and women along the lines of practical industrial chemistry. It started as a one-classroom school that evolved into the Adamson School of Industrial Chemistry and Engineering (ASICE) on February 19, 1936. Upon approval by the Secretary of Public Instruction of its application for university status on February 5, 1941, it became known as Adamson University (AdU).

        George Lucas's cousin Alexander Athos Adamson came to AdU shortly after to help the fledgling school. Alexander joined the administration on July 15, 1932, serving at one time or another as Vice President, Treasurer and Registrar. Much later, Alexander's brother George Athos Adamson also came onboard in 1934, becoming the School Dean, Dean of the College of Engineering and professor. Evdoxia Savaides Adamson, wife of George Lucas, started working and teaching in the University in 1939, then served as Dean of the College of Education and of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Sofia Adamson, George Athos's

wife, taught in the College of Education after arriving in 1939 and briefly served as Directress of the Junior Normal College. Except for George Athos and Sofia who left after the war, all the Adamsons remained working in the University until its turnover to the Vincentian Fathers and Brothers of the Congregation of the Mission in 1964. George Lucas Adamson served as President until 1967, for a total of 35 years, including a three-year holdover stint at the assumption of the Vincentians as administrators.

        Before finally settling on its permanent home along San Marcelino Street in 1946 after the war, the school stayed in three different locations: Sta. Cruz (1932-1933), San Miguel (1933-1939) and Intramuros (1939-1941). In San Marcelino, the University expanded with the acquisition of the Meralco building in 1968 and the St. Theresa's College-Manila campus in 1977, both just across the street.

        Fr. Leandro I. Montañana, C.M., a Spanish Vincentian was the second President and first under the C.M. administration. He served in that capacity until 1985 when Fr. Rolando S. Dela Goza, C.M. the first Filipino university president, succeeded him and served until 1994. Next came Fr. Jimmy Belita, C.M., president until 2003 and was succeeded by Fr. Gregorio L. Bañaga, Jr., C.M who served until 2015. Fr. Marcelo V. Manimtim, CM became the 6th president when he was officially sworn in on December 7, 2015 and formally installed on September 9, 2016.

        Although best known for its chemistry and engineering programs, Adamson gradually added architecture, sciences, pharmacy, business, education, liberal arts, law, graduate school, basic education, and theology courses as it grew bigger. The transfer of ownership in 1964 incorporated the University into the Adamson-Ozanam Educational Institutions, Inc. and led to its transition from a secular to a Catholic institution. St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the C.M., was declared University Patron Saint and the motto Veritas in Caritate (Truth in Charity) was adopted. A new vision was articulated, basically that of offering affordable quality education especially for the socially disadvantaged-one not substantially different from that of the Founder's who wanted to help Filipinos gain a livelihood by offering a maximum amount of practical education in a minimum amount of time. To keep up with the challenges and demands of the time, the University responded by offering information systems and technology, nursing, customs administration, and hospitality management courses.

        The 21st century saw Adamson University gaining a series of achievements under the dynamic leadership of Fr. Bañaga. The University was declared a historic site by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in 2007 during the celebration of its Diamond Jubilee. A marker was placed in front of the campus' St. Vincent Building, the oldest edifice in the University, to commemorate this history.

        In 2010 the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted the Autonomous status and certification for the Institutional Monitoring and Evaluation for Quality Assurance (IQuAME) to the University after passing CHED's rigorous evaluations and visits. This was renewed in 2016. The Autonomous status means that Adamson University has more autonomy or independence in its administration, decision making and implementation; have the privilege to offer new programs and distance courses, among others; and the

authority to grant an Honoris Causa to those deserving following CHED's provisions for granting honorary degrees. The IQuAME certification means that the University has met the requirements and has complied with the standards set forth by CHED to determine the worthiness of its education and service. Seven of its degree programs have also been recognized by CHED as Centers of Development.

        In celebration of its 80th anniversary, Adamson University opened the Adamson University Museum-Founder's Wing in August 2012. The Founder's Wing houses memorabilia and personal effects of Dr. Adamson, which were donated by his family. The items featured in it have been carefully preserved by his widow, Mrs. Evdoxia Savaides Adamson, and were sent from Spain where the Adamson family resides. In 2014, the Vincentian Wing of the museum was added. The section presented the era after the university was turned over by the Founder to the Congregation of the Mission or the Vincentians.

        Strengthening its efforts to achieve excellence, Adamson University applied for and successfully achieved the prestigious ISO 9001:2008 Management Systems certification by TÜV Rheinland in January 2013. In 2017, this was upgraded to ISO 9001:2015. The certification means that the quality of the university's processes and standards are at par with international management systems and that the University has instituted quality assurance methods in both the academic and support services with procedures for its maintenance. In formalizing and maintaining its quality assurance methods, students, parents, and other customers of the University can be assured that teaching quality remains at its best and that transactions are done efficiently. Many of its programs enjoy different levels of accreditation from the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities - Commission on Accreditation (PACU-COA) and other accrediting organizations. In 2015 and 2016, the Philippine Technological Council certified seven engineering programs.

        Being a Vincentian institution, the university also has a strong outreach program supported by a university-wide system of volunteerism through the Vincentian Center for Social Responsibility. Its projects and activities have benefited adopted communities and the marginalized.

        Adamson University has transformed itself into a dynamic and harmonious community of administrators, faculty, employees, and students teaming up to maintain its level of academic excellence to produce socially responsible and globally competitive graduates. Its continuing quest for excellence tempered by its desire to make an impact in its community renders the holistic education offered by the University as true to its aim of providing education with a heart.

VISION

       Adamson University, a Catholic, Vincentian educational institution, is a recognized leading center for quality education particularly for the socially disadvantaged.

MISSION

       As a Catholic University, we diligently pursue truth and knowledge, inspired by Gospel values and guided by the teachings of the Church;

       As a Vincentian community, we inspire others to follow the example of St. Vincent de Paul, who led and organized his contemporaries in creatively responding to those who are in need;

       As an institution of learning, we assist in the formation of competent, creative, and socially responsible leaders through our commitment to excellence in discovery, learning, and service;

       As a catalyst of social transformation, we provide quality services that empower others to become agents of change.




        Saint Vincent de Paul was born at Pouy in Gascony, Southern France in 1581. He came from a poor family of peasants and spent his early years taking care of swine. A rich benefactor sent him to school. At the age of 19, he was ordained priest.

        He had a rather self-seeking start in the priesthood. Under the influence of his spiritual directors, he underwent a striking conversation in which he gave his life over to God in service of the poor. For a few years, he was pastor of a parish and then a chaplain to the galley slaves in Paris. But it was in preaching missions and teaching the peasants in the country side that he found his special calling. He gathered a group of priests who assisted him in conducting missions. The group subsequently became the Congregation of the Mission (1625), a community of priests and brothers whose end is "to preach the good news to the poor."

        Eager to reform the life and training of the clergy, he and his community also organized retreats and established seminaries. In 1633 he gathered together a group of simple girls to minister to the sick poor with the assistance of St. Louise de Marillac. Today this community is known as the Daughters of Charity. He also established the Confraternities of Charity and the Ladies of Charity (lay organizations) to assist the poor.

        When he died on September 27, 1660, all of Paris mourned for him. The Church honors St. Vincent on this day. He is known throughout the world today as the patron of all charitable associations. His spirituality lives on in hundreds of thousands of laymen and women, priests, sisters and brothers who follow in his footsteps.

        On August 3, 1728, Pope Benedict XIII declared Vincent "Blessed". Pope Leo XII constituted him "Universal Patron of Charity" on April 16, 1885. His life-size statue stands in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

        St. Vincent de Paul is the Patron Saint of Adamson University. Inspired by his example, the Vincentian community at Adamson University is committed to provide education particularly to the socially disadvantaged. They believe that education is one of the best ways to develop the human person and to uplift the social condition of the marginalized sectors of society.



        We pursue our vision and accomplish our mission from the following fundamental values that are at the heart of who we are:

SEARCH FOR EXCELLENCE

        The highest standards of academic excellence and professionalism in service are the hallmarks of our educative endeavors. We regularly assess and transform our programs to make them effective for learning discovery of knowledge and community service. Our service ethics manifests strong sense of responsibility, competency, efficiency and professional conduct.

SPIRIT OF ST. VINCENT DE PAUL

        The spirit of St. Vincent inspires and permeates our learning community, programs and services. This spirit is shown in our sensitivity to the presence of God, compassionate service and the building of supportive relationships towards an effective service to persons in need.
SOLIDARITY

        Drawn together by a common vision and mission, we believe education is a shared responsibility and a collaborative effort where the gifts of persons are valued. Our learning community is a "family" where participation, teamwork, interdependence, communication and dialogue prevail. A culture of appreciation builds up our community, encouraging us towards excellence and professionalism.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Education at Adamson University aims at developing a sense of social responsibility
- a mark of an authentic Christian faith. Social responsibility leads us to empower the marginalized sectors of society through the creation of knowledge and human development. We are committed to work for the building of a society based on justice, peace, and respect for human dignity and the integrity ofcreation.

SUSTAINED INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT

        Education is a lifelong quest whose primary purpose is the full and integral development of the human person. We are committed to provide programs for holistic development and continuous learning. Networking with other educational institutions, government agencies, industries, business and other groups enhance our educational services.

        The University Seal embodies the ideal, the commitments, and the aspirations of Adamson University.

        The central circle bears the figure of Athena, half-circled by three white fleur-de-lis flowers, against a background of blue. Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, symbolizes the origin of the University - founded by Dr. George Lucas Adamson, who was assisted by his cousins, Alexander Athos Adamson and George Athos Adamson, all Greeks - and the University's zeal in its quest for knowledge.

        The first fleur-de-lis represents Mary in Her Immaculate Conception, the Patroness of the Philippines, to whom the University professes homage and devotion, and on whose feast day, December 8, the Adamson Ozanam Educational Institutions, Inc. was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

        The second fleur-de-lis stands for St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the Vincentians who direct the University, and for Frederick Ozanam, founder of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The University is placed under the patronage of St. Vincent so that his life may inspire the students and instill in them the moral and social consciousness to help the poor and deprived.

        The third fleur-de-lis alludes to the late Pope Paul VI during whose pontificate the University was transformed from secular to Catholic. He had fleur-de-lis in his coat arms.

        The Latin motto Veritas in Caritate (Truth in Charity) be speaks the University's commitment to human development, especially of the poor and the workingman.

The University colors are blue and white, the same colors adopted by its founder.



        Adamson University is a Catholic learning institution owned and managed by Vincentian priests and brothers. As an educational apostolate of the Congregation of the Mission, the University, consistent to its doctrinal purpose, seeks to cater to the socially disadvantaged students.

SECTION 1. ADAMSON UNIVERSITY THEATER

The Adamson University Theater is the former auditorium of St. Theresa's College- Manila (STC-Manila) that was built in 1940 under the supervision of Engineer Carlos Quisumbing.

The auditorium was a favorite venue for cultural activities, artistic events, academic and social gatherings by students and professionals alike before and after STC-Manila became part of Adamson University in 1977.

In 2005, the major renovation that was started a couple of years back was completed. R.T. de Leon Construction undertook the project based on the design plan of Architect Joel Lopez. The project was accomplished during the presidency of Fr. Gregorio L. Bañaga, Jr., CM.

The Adamson University Theater is a premier venue for staging plays, pageants, concerts, screening films and conducting lectures and conferences.

SECTION 2. ADAMSON UNIVERSITY MUSEUM

2.1 The Founder's Wing

The Founder's Wing is the section dedicated to the memory of Prof. Dr. George Lucas Adamson. The Greek chemist and educator who established the Adamson School of Industrial Chemistry in 1932 in Manila, which became Adamson University in 1941. Dr. Adamson ran the university until 1967 when ownership and administration of the school was passed on to the Vincentian Fathers and Brothers of the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians).


The Founder's Wing is a collaborative effort between the family of Dr. Lucas George Adamson. The founder's son, and the administration of Adamson University led by University President Fr. Gregorio L. Bañaga, Jr., C.M. The former donated the memorabilia of the late founder while the latter provided the space and continuing curatorship of the museum. Contracted to do the planning, research, and concept development, including the construction management, was the Ayala Museum curatorial team headed by Mr. Kenneth Esguerra.

The Founder's Wing exhibits the memorabilia of Dr. Adamson from his brief sojourn in Australia to his retirement as president of Adamson University.

Included in this section of the museum are photos of the two Adamson Brothers-Alexander Athos and George Athos-who were cousins and partners of the founder.

The Adamson University Museum is located on the ground floor of the St. Vincent
Building.


SECTION 3. ADU ART GALLERY

Located at the left side of the AdU Theater, the gallery's latest transformation is the handiwork of Arch. Sylvester Seño, faculty member of the College of Architecture, who was commissioned to design the makeover. From just being a part of the St. Theresa's Auditorium and its surroundings, the gallery now invites a second look because of its interesting Brutalist architecture that carries modernist and deconstructivist elements.

The Brutalist design that Arch. Seño applied is particularly evident in the wavy texture of the lower facade, in the cubist-looking surface of the upper facade, in the triangular shapes carved or embossed on the boundary wall at the terrace and even on the slender grass boxes embedded in the terrace itself. The linear and angled character of the design is echoed in the two-floor interior, notably in the stair case, ceiling and glass panels.

The art gallery has mounted several arts and photo exhibits and serves as holding area for special guests of the theater.


SECTION 4. ADAMSON UNIVERSITY GYMNASIUM AND COVERED COURT

The gymnasium and covered court are the training facilities for the athletic sport teams of the University especially the Adamson Falcons.

At muling magbabalik sa 'king pinagmulan
Tagumpay ang hatid ng isang ganap na Adamsonian.
III
Sa kapwa ako'y laging mapagmahal, Hindi lumilimot sa Maykapal.
Nagsisilbi ng tapat sa bayang sinilangan. Taas noo sa buong mundong ipagsisigawan.
Tulay:
Patuloy na lilipad ang isang Adamsonian, Magiging matatag sa hamon ng buhay!
Koda:
...tagumpay ang hatid, hindi padadaig, Laging mananaig ang isang ganap na Adamsonian!

Adamson Prayer:
Dear Lord,
Teach me the things that are important:
To be generous with Your gifts,
Compassionate to those who have less,
Just in the face of unfair circumstances,
True when the world's values contradict my own,
Gracious when things don't go my way,
And magnanimous when they do.
May nothing else matter
Except Faith in Your goodness, my neighbor's, and mine,
Hope that things can get better,
And Charity that always sets things right.
May Your special Love for the Poor,
The mark of my uniquely Vincentian education,
Be the work I excel in,
The standard I constantly refer to,
And my courage when I meet You someday.
O Mary conceived without sin,
Pray for us who have recourse to thee.
St. Vincent de Paul,
Pray for us.

Adamson Hymn:
Adamson Alma Mater dear
All hail thy name
In our wand'ring far or near
We'll spread thy fame 
Within thy portals hallowed 
True wisdom we have followed 
In every clime our loyal hearts 
Will never fail 
Through changeless time 
Dear Adamson U hail! 
Fling out thy banner high
The blue and white 
Lift our voices to the sky 
With raging might 
Each noble son and daughter
From thee will never falter 
Thru ev'ry hour to keep us 
Faithful, strong and pure 
God grant us pow'r to
Make our triumph sure!
